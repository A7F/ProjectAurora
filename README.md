# Project Aurora
Taking RGB gaming mousepads a step further

## Current progress
Still a work in progress: the program compiles but there's a lot more to do. Up to now you can only customize LED colors choosing different light layouts.

## To-Do
- Improving serial protocol communication (including handshakes, checksums and headers)
- Adding OLED settings handlers
- Adding macro configurator
- Fixing all the JFrames
- Omg there's really too much to do :S
